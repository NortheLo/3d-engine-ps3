# What is this project?
This should become a 3d engine fps for the ps3 using the PSL1GHT SDK.
Right now I am figuring out how the SDK and the PS3 works, so a clean code is not a priority.
As soon as the basic functions are working, a major refactor has to be done.  
Then this engine should get used in a DOOM/QUAKE-esque game.   
Sporadically this code gets tested on a "real" PS3 with HEN (4.90), but development is done with the emulator RPCS3. 
## How to run
Install:
 - RPCS3 emulator 
 - PSL1GHT SDK and the ps3 toolchains installed.
